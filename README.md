# IT Audit Compliance Dashboard / General IT Controls Home Lab

## Purpose
GITC (also abbreviated as ITGC) audits support the reliability, integrity, and security of IT environments by assessing controls. As businesses continue to manage and process large volumes of (potentially sensitive) data, the organizational value of these audits is realized in regulatory compliance and business resilience.

## Key Tasks
1. Evaluating user access controls, change management, system operations, and backup processes.
2. Reviewing system logs, cloud security settings, and database permissions.
3. Documenting findings in an audit report with recommendations.
